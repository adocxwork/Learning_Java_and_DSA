1. byte, short, int, long = 0
float, double = 0.0
chat = ''
boolean = false
String = null

2. No

3. Heap memory

4. Size of an array is fixed, we can't change it.., if we need to change, we need to have a new array.
Array's element data type is homogeneous. An array will have a single data type of elements.

5. An anonymous array in java is an array which is used only once and is used without variables so that,
it does not requires documentations for variables.

"new int[]{7,8,9}" >> this would return an array of value {7,8,9} and does not requires a variable.

6. i. Traditional For loop traversal
for(int i=0; i<num.length; i++)
{
System.out.print(num[i] + " ");
}

ii. Enhanced for loop traversal
for(int i : num)
{
System.out.print(i + " ");
}

7. length >> it is used to find the length of an array
like,
num.length will return the length of array num.

length() >> it is used to find the length of a String
like,
name.length() will return the length of String name.


length >> Array
length() >> String
